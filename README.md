make some bingo cards

It's nice not to write up ways to parse things to a CSV so people can read it.  

I made up some bingo cards for the kids school in anticipation of a virtual fall festival.

* Makes as many as you like.
* Use text or an image for the Free Space
* Use text or an image for board Header
* It will print out 1 card to a page

Set your variables and away you go, BINGO cards on an HTML page.

Have fun with it.  I did.
